# ZeroTrace
A privacy‑first, end‑to‑end encrypted communication platform. Messages are encrypted on the client and decrypted only by the recipient. The backend acts as a blind router, never accessing plaintext. Built for real‑time secure messaging with public‑key identities, ZeroTrace demonstrates true zero‑knowledge communication across web and mobile.
